Patch 7.0.3 support and some minor bug fixes.


--------------------

Brizag:
	- [Bug fix] When granting EP, ignore additional alts in the raid, so that no one is granted twice
	- More informative tooltips in the main list UI. Show server for alts from other server. Show main name for alts.
	- When specifying main in officer note, support 'short' names (without server part)
	- Sorted enUS localization strings for easier comparison
	- Add Brazilian Portuguese and Italian localizations.
	- Automatically package localizations from CurseForge repository.
	- Fix outdated comment, we store full names internally, including the server portion.
	- Bump TOC for WoW 7.0.3
	- In WoW patch 7.0.3 item links can have empty fields instead of zeros. This fixes the "attempt to concatenate local 'uniqueid' (a nil value)" error.
