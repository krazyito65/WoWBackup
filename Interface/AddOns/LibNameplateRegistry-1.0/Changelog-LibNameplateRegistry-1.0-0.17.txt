--------------------

John Wellesz:
	- Fix stupidity in last commit
	- If a plate is registered with "Unknown" as unit name the library will retry to get the real value when necessary
	This happens if a nameplate is created for a player that just entered the world...
	- Fix undue 'frame reference not found in active plates: nil' debug message
