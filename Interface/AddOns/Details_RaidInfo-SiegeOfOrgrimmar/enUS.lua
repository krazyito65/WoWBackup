Loc ["STRING_RAID_NAME"] = "Siege of Orgrimmar"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The ancient inhabitants of Pandaria recognized the vital importance of the lifegiving Pools of Power, building an underground system of aqueducts to safeguard the waters and nurture life in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The touch of corruption has animated and twisted these waters, and Immerseus stands as an unnatural embodiment of the Vale's sorrow.
Loc ["STRING_IMMERSEUS"] = "Immerseus"

-- The Golden Lotus and Shado-Pan guardians of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms were caught in the epicenter of the devastating blast that scarred the Vale, and torn apart by the dark energies. Their spirits linger in the place they once protected, confused and tormented by their failure.
Loc ["STRING_THEFALLENPROTECTORS"] = "The Fallen Protectors"

-- Some say that the mogu race was created in the image of this titanic construct, left deep beneath Pandaria to watch over and guard the continent's darkest and most dangerous secret.
Loc ["STRING_NORUSHEN"] = "Norushen"

-- The seventh sha, the Sha of Pride, was the final burden to which Emperor Shaohao clung, shrouding the land in mist and biding its time for millennia. When Garrosh awakened the Heart of Y'Shaarj, the force of his arrogance caused this dark energy to coalesce in the chamber where the Heart was unearthed.
Loc ["STRING_SHAOFPRIDE"] = "Sha of Pride"

-- Warlord Zaela formed a close bond with Garrosh during events in the Twilight Highlands, and she and her Dragonmaw orcs have pledged loyalty to Garrosh's cause. Riding atop the fearsome Galakras, a direct descendant of the cataclysmic progenitor of all dragonkind, Zaela oversees the naval defense of Orgrimmar.
Loc ["STRING_GALAKRAS"] = "Galakras"

-- This mechanical terror, designed nearly as much for intimidation as destruction, is the centerpiece of Garrosh's siege weaponry. Crafted in the image of the mighty Kor'kron war scorpion, the Iron Juggernaut guards the gates of Orgrimmar, crushing any who would rise up to challenge Garrosh's True Horde.
Loc ["STRING_IRONJUGGERNAUT"] = "Iron Juggernaut"

-- Haromm and Kardris trained thousands of shaman to whisper reverently to the elements to requisition their aid. The army of Garrosh, however, does not ask - they take what they desire in the name of the True Horde. Dark Shamanism forces the elements into servitude, twisting them into burned-out ash, corrupted waters, and toxic air.
Loc ["STRING_KORKRONDARKSAMAN"] = "Kor'kron Dark Shaman"

-- Once a grunt in service of the former warchief, Thrall, General Nazgrim rose quickly through the ranks after overwhelming victories in Grizzly Hills and the sunken city of Vashj'ir. Fiercely loyal to the Horde and bound by a rigorous code of honor and duty, Nazgrim will hold the line for his warchief until his dying breath.
Loc ["STRING_GENERALNAZFRIM"] = "General Nazgrim"

-- Malkorok has been Garrosh's most loyal and trusted lieutenant throughout the Pandaria campaign. When the Warchief needed a volunteer to infuse with the power of Y'Shaarj, it was only natural that Malkorok would offer without hesitation.
Loc ["STRING_MALKOROK"] = "Malkorok"

-- When Garrosh gazed across Pandaria, he saw untapped power. During the course of his campaign, Garrosh has plundered weapons, treasures, and artifacts of the pandaren, the mogu, and the mantid. They are kept in a warehouse deep within his underground base, guarded by a mysterious security system that appears to be of Titan origins.
Loc ["STRING_SPOILSOFPANDARIA"] = "Spoils of Pandaria"

-- When the Isle of Giants was discovered off the coast of Pandaria, teeming with primal devilsaurs, Garrosh sent men to capture some of the most fearsome specimens, hoping to subjugate them and use them as beasts of war. Countless orcish beastmasters have fallen to Thok's jaws as they struggle to tame him, yet the creature's thirst for blood remains unslaked.
Loc ["STRING_THOKTHEBLOODTHIRSTY"] = "Thok the Bloodthirsty"

-- Helix Blackfuse was the only goblin with the combination of engineering prowess, professionalism, and ruthlessness to satisfy Garrosh in his search for the engineer of the True Horde. A mercenary at heart, Blackfuse's love for his creations (and the gold they fetch) has forever linked his fate with that of his patron and Warchief.
Loc ["STRING_SIEGECRAFTERBLACKFUSE"] = "Siegecrafter Blackfuse"

-- The nine surviving Klaxxi'va Paragons are ancient champions of the mantid who fought alongside the Wakener against the madness of Empress Shek'zeer. But the paragons, as do all mantid, hold a far deeper loyalty. When Garrosh unearthed the heart of Y'Shaarj, the paragons followed the whispers of their ancient master to the iron halls beneath Orgrimmar.
Loc ["STRING_PARAGEONSOFTHEKLAXXI"] = "Paragons of the Klaxxi"

-- Garrosh, son of Grommash Hellscream, first learned of his father's heroism when Thrall encountered the young orc in Outland. The seeds of pride were planted. Garrosh spearheaded Horde victories in Northrend and, as Warchief, consolidated Horde power amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. But his visions of orc supremacy by any means have brought the armies of the world crashing down upon Orgrimmar... a final reckoning that Garrosh himself awaits with brutal relish.
Loc ["STRING_GARROSHHELLSCREAM"] = "Garrosh Hellscream"
