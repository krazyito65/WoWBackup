		description This is another version of the previous macro. This has "/startattack" added in, so I wouldn't use it as your main Hunter's Mark macro, but it is great for switching targets in the heat of battle. *I put "/focus [party]" because sometimes your focus target might be targetting a friendly NPC, and if you assist your focus target, and they're targetting a friendly NPC, your focus target will switch to that NPC, which can get annoying. I would still be careful with this because your tank might be targetting a healer, then it would switch your focus to that healer. Honestly, I wouldn't put in that last line unless you want to change focus targets on the fly and you know what target is going to be set to focus target.

		description This is the final version of the Hunter's Mark macro. I have taken out the setting of the party member as a focus and replaced it with my pet attacking the assist target that I have gotten. I suggest setting your focus target manually, just in case your focus target is targetting something that the macro can set as a focus target. This will also send your pet to attack your focus target's target, which will happen as soon as you switch targets, which is quicker than WoW's "petassist" mode, espcially if you're casting a spell or ability that take a few seconds.
