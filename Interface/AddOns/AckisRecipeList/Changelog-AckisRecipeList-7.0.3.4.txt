--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Fix profession dumping for Ressy - file load order change invalidated an upvalue in the main chunk of the scanner.
	- Add IsRecipeInfoLearnedByDescendant and IsRecipeInfoUnlearnedByAncestor helpers to ignore irrelevant recipe ranks, since the information is now available via C_TradeSkillUI.
	- Remove Recipe:SetAsKnownOrLinked in favor of moving its logic inline to the only place it was ever called.
	- Remove search for profession spellID via localized profession name and subsequent generation of the same localized profession name by said spellID, because what the hell?!?
	- Syntax cleanup.
