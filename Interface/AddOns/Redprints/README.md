Redprints
=========

Are you tired of hovering over each individual blueprint in your Garrison when looking for a blueprint you have not yet learned?

Then this addon could be for you!


What it does
------------

This incredibly lightweight addon will highlight all of the Garrison Blueprints your character knows in a colour of your choice.  The default colour is red, but you can change it to green, blue or grey.

Unlearned blueprints will remain the default colour and will be easier to find.


Configuration
-------------

The colour of the highlight can be changed using typing ```"/redprints"``` followed by either ```"red"```, ```"green"```, ```"blue"```, or ```"grey"```.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language.
